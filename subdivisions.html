            <p class="text-justify">The Los Angeles police Department operates sub departments called sub divisions. These divisions are specialized in handling a variety of unusual situations that come up in the city of Los Angeles. These sub divisions are operated by officers in the department. Some LAPD Officers are specially trained in these subdivisions to handle and carry out situations that would be more difficult for a normal Officer to handle. All subdivisions will have different SOP's and rosters that you need to follow and abide by. As well each sub division will have a different hiring process for what rank you can be at to apply.</p>

                    traditional law enforcement first responders and/or investigative units. The
                    primary purpose of SWAT is to provide a systematic approach to saving lives in
                    accordance with the priorities of life and the specific standards set forth
                    in the SOP, in concert with the totality of circumstances presented. While life
                    safety is a priority of SWAT, the specific circumstances will dictate the level of
                    force necessary to adequately protect the public and the officers involved.
                    Resolution of some incidents may require the specific application of various
                    levels of force, up to and including, deadly force.</p>
